Summary of Findings â€“ Titanic EDA
-Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
-1st class passengers were more likely to survive than 2nd and 3rd class.
-Younger passengers had slightly better chances of survival.
-Higher fare correlated with higher survival odds.
-Missing values were mainly in the Age and Cabin columns.
-Correlation heatmap showed strong links between Survived, Fare, and Pclass.
Performed Titanic EDA by analyzing data stats, handling missing values, visualizing trends (heatmap, boxplot, pairplot), and summarizing survival insights.
